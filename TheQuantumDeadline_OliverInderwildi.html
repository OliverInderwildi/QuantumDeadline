  <h1>THE QUANTUM DEADLINE: Telcos Face a Make-or-Break Moment</h1>
  <p class="byline">by Oliver Inderwildi</p>

  <p><em>Extended version of an <a href="https://www.thefastmode.com%2Fexpert-opinion%2F42971-the-quantum-deadline-telcos-face-a-make-or-break-moment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
 Editorial Opinion
</a> published in <a href="https://www.thefastmode.com target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
 The Fast Mode 
</a>. The article is also available on  <a href="https://medium.com/p/c0b875880dd5">Medium</a>.</em></p>

  <p>
    Our lives increasingly take place in a virtual world, humans connect on social media, shop online
    and our health records are uploaded to an enormous cyber cloud. All this has tremendous upsides
    and —after all—our data is protected via encryption. Still, <a https://eurepoc.eu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  data breaches
</a> are becoming more and
    more common—encrypted data is stolen and stored by state and non-state players with one goal:
    decrypt this data later, an approach referred to as <a href="https://www.thefastmode.com/podcasts/37912-securing-networks-in-the-age-of-ai-and-quantum-computing-nokia-threat-intelligence-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  harvest now, decrypt later (HNDL)
</a>
</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    What are the entities involved in HNDL speculating on? Rapid technological progress. Large
    language models, LLMs, for instance have emerged at a pace that even the most bullish experts
    didn’t anticipate. Meanwhile, quantum computing (QC) breakthroughs are stacking up faster than
    expected—with test results showing performance gains far beyond the most optimistic projections.
  </p>

  <p>
    In my view, the ascent of QC will follow a similar path to generative AI: it will appear suddenly and
    develop at breakneck speed. <a href="https://medium.com/@oliverinderwildi/the-quantum-computing-revolution-unlocking-solutions-to-humanitys-toughest-problems-part-1-ffe2ebbeb001" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Operational QCs will allow quantum decryption</a>, which will break
    current encryption standards like a hammer cracks a walnut. All of a sudden, it does make sense to
    steal encrypted data, because it won’t be encrypted for long, QC is closer than we think. That’s why
    we need to confront its consequences right now!
  </p>

  <h2>The Illusion of Time: Why 2030 Is Too Late</h2>

  <p>
    Until recently, 2030 was considered the earliest possible date for cryptographically relevant
    quantum computers (CRQC). However, that timeline is rapidly collapsing as <a href="https://time.com/7282334/the-quantum-era-has-begun/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in the past year alone </a>:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Google’s Willow reduced a 10-septillion-year problem to a 5-minute calculation.</li>
    <li>Microsoft discovered a new quantum phase of matter, a breakthrough for error correction.</li>
    <li>D-Wave and Quantinuum solved previously intractable problems.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Perhaps most significantly, we’re seeing the first signs of a quantum–AI feedback loop: artificial
    intelligence is accelerating <a href="https://medium.com/the-geopolitical-economist/the-quantum-computing-revolution-geopolitics-economics-c2380e0167ee" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quantum computer design and operation</a> , and quantum machines will
    soon return the favour. These developments strongly suggest that cryptographically relevant QCs
    will be operational years earlier than even the most optimistic forecasts predicted. In short, the
    so-called Q-Day—the day when current encryption will be rendered useless by operational QCs and
    their deciphering abilities —is approaching rapidly. The graphic below gives a short timeline of
    quantum computing, from Feynman’s ideation to the near future. The probability of Q-Day hitting
    this decade is, in my opinion, close to 100% and this will have consequences for every one of us as
    we’ll explore hereafter.
  </p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> A short timeline of Quantum Computing, the probability for Q-Day materialising this decade is—according to my assessment—close to 100%.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <h2>The End of Privacy: What Quantum Decryption means for all of us</h2>

  <p>
    What policymakers and telecom leaders must understand: the “harvest now, decrypt later” threat is
    no longer theoretical. State intelligence services and corporate espionage actors have already
    harvested vast troves of encrypted data—just waiting for them to be unlocked by the Quantum
    Dietrich—a truly universal digital lockpick. A <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2024/766237/EPRS_BRI(2024)766237_EN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2024 briefing</a> from the European Parliamentary
    Research Service and a <a href="https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Transitioning%20to_a_Quantum_Secure_Economy_2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2022 white paper</a> from the World Economic Forum confirm that state and
    corporate actors are hoarding sensitive communications today, betting on future decryption. Hence,
    HNDL attacks are selectively targeting data with long-term value such as health and financial
    records, government data, corporate IP and other Personal Identifiable Information (PII), the graphic
    below shows a breakdown.
  </p>

  <figure id="figure-2" class="figure-wide">
    <img src="figure2.png" alt="HNDL attacks selectively target data with long-term strategic value; estimated distribution of harvested data and examples." />
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> HNDL attacks selectively target data with long-term strategic value such as governmental, corporate and personal data. The estimates shown are the result of a meta-analysis of data by Rand Corp., The Quantum Insider, the US Government Accountability Office, the US Chamber of Commerce, The Wall Street Journal, Microsoft and others.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Once CRQCs arrive, decades of encrypted secrets—health records, financial transactions, state
    communications—WILL be exposed retroactively. The inflection point of quantum decryption will
    reverberate through the global economy, national security and the financial system—read an
    assessment of these effects in this <a href="https://medium.com/the-geopolitical-economist/the-quantum-computing-revolution-geopolitics-economics-c2380e0167ee" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">article.</a>
  </p>

  <h2>Public Duty: Why the Telecom Industry Must Lead</h2>

  <p>
    The telecommunications industry is key to safeguarding our national interests, economic wellbeing
    and privacy; they are the pillar of the digital infrastructure as they own fiber networks, edge
    facilities and data centres. This infrastructure is key to QC operation, however, it is also the Achilles
    heel as it is the entrance point of malign entities preying on data; industry leaders have the duty to
    think ahead and implement safeguards for nation states and their inhabitants. One could counter this
    statement with the fact that it indeed the state that should implement these safeguards, yet, this time
    it is different as we’ll explore hereafter.
  </p>

  <h2>The Governance Lag: Policy is Struggling to Keep Up</h2>

  <p>
    Technological innovation has long outpaced democratic decision-making. Not due to unwillingness
    or inertia, but because democratic processes require consensus-building, consultation, and
    regulation drafting—all inherently slow. By the time legislation catches up, technology has already
    evolved—and this trend will not reverse. Policy makers have to prioritise smart and adaptive
    policies that automatically adapt to tech developments – I am well aware that this is easier said than
    done, yet successful examples of  <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0040162510000727" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">such political innovation exist!</a> The United States via <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2024/08/nist-releases-first-3-finalized-post-quantum-encryption-standards" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> NIST’s Post
    Quantum Encryption Standards</a> and the European Union via its <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/press-room-item/2024-07-10/european-quantum-act-adopted-by-european-parliament" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">European Quantum Act</a>, have taken
    measures, but there will be a lag between action and implementation.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the meantime, the telecommunications industry, masters of the digital infrastructure, have to step
    in and take responsibility—the means to upgrade telecommunications are available <a href="https://medium.com/itnext/quantum-computing-wont-break-the-internet-it-will-just-force-us-to-update-it-7a1cc67bfddf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the means to upgrade telecommunications are available</a>. In the medium
    term, the industry will benefit from this.
  </p>

  <h2>Enormous Opportunity: Another Frontier Era Within Reach</h2>

  <p>
    The risk story is clear—but the opportunity story is just as compelling. Quantum computing doesn’t
    just threaten existing systems; it offers telecoms a pathway to growth, differentiation, and relevance
    in the next technological era. Telcos stand to benefit in two major ways: first, by commercialising
    Quantum-Computing-as-a-Service (QCaaS) <a href="https://www.thefastmode.com/technology-solutions/25634-qusecure-databridge-sites-to-showcase-quantum-as-a-service-orchestration-platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Quantum-Computing-as-a-Service (QCaaS)</a> for industries such as banking, pharmaceuticals,
    logistics, and cloud computing; second, by using quantum algorithms internally to optimise routing,
    reduce energy use, and enhance fault prediction. Industries like transport, energy, and hyperscale
    cloud platforms are already exploring quantum-enhanced efficiencies —and they will pay a
    premium to access these capabilities through trusted telecom partners.
  </p>

  <p>
    According to McKinsey, quantum-encrypted communication (QEC), i.e. a safeguard against
    quantum decryption, will likely be the first QC-related commercial product with <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-explainers/what-is-quantum-computing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an estimated
    market size of US$13 billion</a>. Figure 3 illustrates the scenarios for the market size of the safeguard
    by 2035 giving the actual 2023 market size as benchmark. The compound annual growth rate
    (CAGR) of 23 to 25 % clearly illustrates a key message:
  </p>

  </figure>

 <p class="key-insight">
  Quantum computing isn’t just a risk; it brings enormous economic, environmental and societal opportunities—and the telecom sector is uniquely equipped to reap these benefits.
  </p>

  <h2>The Time is Now: The Roadmap to Quantum Readiness</h2>

  <p>
    There is no silver bullet—but there is a clear path forward. Telecoms can begin by laying the
    groundwork: auditing quantum risk exposure, launching post-quantum cryptography in sensitive
    sectors, and identifying fiber corridors for quantum key distribution. The second phase could
    involve piloting of QKD in selected sectors, building sandbox environments for quantum-safe 5G/
    6G, and training internal teams. The final phase is scale and monetisation—offering QCaaS to
    enterprise clients, integrating quantum optimisation into network operations, and establishing
    regional quantum backbone status. Each step compounds strategic advantage—and shrinks the
    window of vulnerability.
  </p>

  <h2>The Bottom Line: Quantum Decryption Will Emerge—But It Won’t Announce Itself</h2>

  <p>
    Quantum decryption won’t arrive with ceremony. It will arrive quietly—and with seismic
    consequences. It will shake the foundations of  <a href="https://medium.com/@oliverinderwildi/the-quantum-computing-revolution-unlocking-solutions-to-humanitys-toughest-problems-part-1-ffe2ebbeb001" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">global security, enterprise trust, and data governance</a>.
    The telcos that act now will become national assets. Perhaps even digital first responders in a new
    kind of technological emergency. Those that delay? They risk irrelevance—or worse. Telcos have
    already mastered electricity and light harnessing the economic benefits. I believe they can master &amp;
    monetise the quantum revolution as well—if they act now.
